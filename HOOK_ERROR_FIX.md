# React Error #310 Fix Summary

## Problem
React Error #310 occurs when React Hooks are called conditionally or in the wrong order. This happens when:
- Hooks are called after early returns
- Hooks are called conditionally
- Hooks are called in loops

## Root Cause
In `app/page.tsx`, all React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo) were being called AFTER early return statements. This violated the Rules of Hooks, causing React to throw error #310.

## Solution
**ALL HOOKS MUST BE CALLED BEFORE ANY EARLY RETURNS**

The fix ensures that:
1. All hooks are called at the top of the component
2. Early returns happen AFTER all hooks are called
3. Hook order is consistent across renders

## Changes Made

### Before (Broken):
```typescript
// Early returns before hooks
if (status === 'loading') {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}

if (status === 'unauthenticated') {
  return null;
}

// Hooks called after early returns (WRONG!)
const statsData = useMemo(() => {...}, [deps]);
const stats = useMemo(() => {...}, [deps]);
useEffect(() => {...}, [deps]);
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
// ALL HOOKS CALLED FIRST
const statsData = useMemo(() => {...}, [deps]);
const stats = useMemo(() => {...}, [deps]);
useEffect(() => {...}, [deps]);
useEffect(() => {...}, [deps]);

// THEN early returns
if (status === 'loading') {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}

if (status === 'unauthenticated') {
  return null;
}
```

## Key Files Modified
- `app/page.tsx`: Reordered hooks to be called before early returns

## Verification
- ✅ Build passes without errors
- ✅ No duplicate React versions detected
- ✅ All hooks called unconditionally at the top level
- ✅ No hooks called conditionally or in loops

## Rules to Follow
1. **Always call hooks at the top level** - Never inside conditions, loops, or nested functions
2. **Call hooks in the same order every render** - This allows React to track state between renders
3. **No hooks after early returns** - Early returns must come AFTER all hook calls
4. **Only call hooks from React components** - Don't call hooks from regular JavaScript functions

## Prevention
To prevent this error in the future:
- Always structure components with all hooks before any conditional logic
- Use ESLint rules: `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`
- Test builds before deployment
- Review code for hook ordering
