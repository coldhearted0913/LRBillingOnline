# 🧪 Testing Guide - Quick Wins Implementation

## ✅ Completed Improvements

### 1. Toast Notifications (Testing)
**What was changed:** Replaced all `alert()` calls with toast notifications

**How to test:**
1. **Create a new LR** with missing fields → Should see toast error at top-right
2. **Delete LRs** → Should see success toast with count
3. **Change status** → Should see toast confirmation
4. **Generate bills** without selecting LRs → Should see error toast
5. **Bulk status change** → Should see success toast with count

**Expected behavior:** 
- Toasts appear at top-right corner
- Green toasts for success
- Red toasts for errors
- Auto-dismiss after 2-4 seconds
- No blocking of UI

### 2. Database Indexes (Testing)
**What was changed:** Added 8 indexes to improve query performance

**How to test:**
1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
2. Load the dashboard
3. Apply filters (month/year/status)
4. Search for LRs
5. Notice response times

**Expected behavior:**
- Faster page loads (50-60% improvement expected)
- Quicker filter application
- Smooth pagination

**Performance benchmarks:**
- Dashboard load: < 1 second (for 100+ records)
- Filter application: < 200ms
- Status updates: < 300ms

### 3. Input Validation (Testing)
**What was changed:** Added Zod validation schemas for LR creation and user registration

#### A. LR Form Validation (Server-side)
**How to test:**

1. **Invalid LR Number:**
   - Try: `AB` (too short)
   - Try: `AB@#$%` (special characters)
   - **Expected:** Error: "LR Number must be at least 3 characters" or "can only contain letters, numbers..."

2. **Invalid Date Format:**
   - Try: `2024-01-01` (wrong format)
   - **Expected:** Error: "Date must be in DD-MM-YYYY format"

3. **Invalid Vehicle Number:**
   - Try: `AB` (too short)
   - Try: `AB@12` (special characters)
   - **Expected:** Error about vehicle number format

4. **Same Consignor and Consignee:**
   - Enter same value in both fields
   - **Expected:** Error: "Consignor and Consignee cannot be the same"

5. **Missing Required Fields:**
   - Submit without LR Number, Date, or Vehicle Type
   - **Expected:** Validation error messages

#### B. User Registration Validation (Server-side)
**How to test:**

1. **Weak Password:**
   - Try: `123456` (no uppercase)
   - Try: `abc123` (no uppercase)
   - **Expected:** Error about password requirements

2. **Invalid Email:**
   - Try: `notanemail`
   - **Expected:** Error: "Please enter a valid email address"

3. **Short Name:**
   - Try: `A` (single character)
   - **Expected:** Error: "Name must be at least 2 characters"

4. **Long Fields:**
   - Try 100+ character names
   - **Expected:** Error about length limits

---

### 4. Loading States (Visual Testing)
**What was changed:** Added loading indicators

**How to test:**
1. Open dashboard
2. Apply a filter
3. Watch for loading spinner
4. Notice "Loading LRs..." message

**Expected behavior:**
- Spinner appears during data fetch
- Smooth transitions
- No blank screens

## 🔍 Detailed Test Scenarios

### Test Case 1: LR Creation with Validation
```bash
Steps:
1. Click "Create New LR"
2. Leave all fields empty
3. Click "Save"
Expected: Error toasts for required fields

4. Fill in:
   - LR No: "123" (too short)
   - Date: "2024-01-01" (wrong format)
   - Vehicle: "AB" (too short)
5. Click "Save"
Expected: Multiple error toasts with specific messages
```

### Test Case 2: User Registration
```bash
Steps:
1. Login as CEO
2. Go to Profile Settings → Users
3. Click "Add User"
4. Try creating user with:
   - Email: "test" (invalid)
   - Password: "123" (weak)
   - Name: "A" (too short)
Expected: Validation error toasts

5. Fill correctly:
   - Email: "test@example.com"
   - Password: "Test123456" (meets requirements)
   - Name: "Test User"
Expected: Success toast + user created
```

### Test Case 3: Performance Testing
```bash
Steps:
1. Create 50+ dummy LRs (if not exists)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Open dashboard
4. Measure load time
5. Apply month filter
6. Measure response time
7. Search for specific LR
8. Measure response time

Expected results:
- Dashboard load: < 2 seconds
- Filter application: < 500ms
- Search results: < 300ms
```

### Test Case 4: Toast Notifications
```bash
Steps:
1. Try to delete without selecting → Error toast
2. Delete 3 LRs → Success toast with count
3. Try generate bills without selection → Error toast
4. Change status → Success toast
5. Generate bills → Success toast with details

Expected:
- Non-blocking notifications
- Auto-dismiss after 2-4 seconds
- Stack properly if multiple appear
- Dismissable by clicking
```
