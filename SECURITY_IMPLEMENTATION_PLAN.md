  email         String    @unique
  password      String    (hashed)
  name          String

  isActive      Boolean   @default(true)
  createdAt     DateTime  @default(now())

  // Relations
  lrs           LR[]      (if tracking who created)
  auditLogs     AuditLog[]
  
  @@map("users")
}

enum Role {
  CEO
  MANAGER
  WORKER
}

model AuditLog {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  userId        String

}
```

## 🔐 IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### **PHASE 1: AUTHENTICATION (NextAuth.js)**

**What to add:**
- Login page (simple, matches existing colors)
- Logout button (top-right, minimal)
- Session management
- Password hashing

**Files to create:**
```
lib/auth.ts                 ← NextAuth configuration
pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts  ← Auth endpoints
components/LoginForm.tsx    ← Login UI (matches theme)
middleware.ts              ← Protect routes
```

**User Flow:**
1. First load → If not logged in → Show login page
2. User enters email/password
3. System checks database
4. If first user → Create CEO account
5. If valid → Create session → Redirect to dashboard

**NO UI CHANGES:**
- Dashboard stays exactly the same
- Forms stay exactly the same
- Just add login gate before accessing

---

### **PHASE 2: AUDIT LOGGING**

**What to track:**
```
CREATE  → When user creates LR/Bill
EDIT    → When user edits entry
DELETE  → When user deletes entry
LOGIN   → When user logs in
LOGOUT  → When user logs out
EXPORT  → When user downloads bill
INVITE  → When admin invites user
ROLE_CHANGE → When role assigned
```

**Implementation:**
- Add audit function in lib/audit.ts
- Call audit() after every action
- Store in database
- Create admin page to view logs (future)

**Example:**
```typescript
// After creating LR
await auditLog({
  userId: session.user.id,
  action: 'CREATE',
  resource: 'LR',
  resourceId: newLR.id,
  newValue: newLR,
})
```

**NO UI CHANGES:**
- Audit logging happens silently in background
- Users don't see anything

---

### **PHASE 3: RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**

**Implementation:**
```
middleware.ts
├── Check if user logged in
├── Check if user has permission
└── Block if unauthorized

API routes
├── /api/lrs → Check role → CEO/MANAGER/WORKER access
├── /api/admin → CEO only
└── /api/audit → CEO only

Components
├── Show/hide buttons based on role
├── Worker sees own data only
└── Manager sees all data
```

**Permission Matrix:**
```
         | CEO | MANAGER | WORKER
---------|-----|---------|--------
View All | YES | YES     | OWN
Create   | YES | YES     | YES
Edit     | YES | YES     | OWN
Delete   | YES | YES     | NO
Export   | YES | YES     | OWN
Invite   | YES | NO      | NO
View Logs| YES | NO      | NO
```

**NO UI CHANGES:**
- Dashboard looks the same
- Worker just sees less data
- No new buttons or forms

---

### **PHASE 4: AUTOMATED BACKUPS**

**Daily Backup Process:**
```
Every day at 2 AM (configurable):
1. Export database from Neon
2. Encrypt backup
3. Upload to S3 backup bucket
4. Keep last 30 days
5. Delete old backups
```

**Implementation Options:**

**Option A: Simple (Recommended)**
```bash
# Cron job on Railway (built-in)
# Runs every day
# Uses pg_dump to backup
# Uploads to S3
```

**Option B: Advanced**
```bash
# Use a backup service:
# - Neon built-in backups (7 days)
# - S3 Bucket versioning
# - AWS Backup service
```

**Files to create:**
```
lib/backup.ts           ← Backup logic
pages/api/admin/backup  ← Manual backup trigger
```

**NO UI CHANGES:**
- Backups happen automatically
- Optional: Add "Manual Backup" button in admin (future)

---

## 📊 DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

### **STEP 1: Install NextAuth**
```bash
npm install next-auth@latest
```

### **STEP 2: Create Auth Configuration**
- Set up JWT strategy
- Configure Neon database
- Add email/password provider
- Set session timeout

### **STEP 3: Create Users Table**
```bash
npm run db:migrate --name add_auth
```

### **STEP 4: Create Login Page**
- Simple form (email, password)
- Match existing colors (check current theme)
- "Sign In" button
- Error messages

### **STEP 5: Protect Routes**
```typescript
// In middleware.ts
if (!session) redirect('/login')
```

### **STEP 6: Add Audit Logging**
- Create audit.ts utility
- Add calls in all API routes
- Track all user actions

### **STEP 7: Implement RBAC**
- Add role checks to API routes
- Update components to show/hide based on role

### **STEP 8: Set Up Backups**
- Configure backup script
- Test restore process
- Schedule daily runs

## 🎨 UI PRESERVATION CHECKLIST

**Keep EXACTLY the same:**
- [ ] Dashboard layout & colors
- [ ] Forms (LR, Bills, etc)
- [ ] Table styling
- [ ] Buttons & icons
- [ ] Navigation bar (add logout only)
- [ ] Responsive design
- [ ] All animations & transitions

**Only add:**
- [ ] Login page (separate, before dashboard)
- [ ] Logout button (top-right corner)
- [ ] Optional: User name display (top-right)

---

## 🔧 MINIMAL UI ADDITIONS

**Navigation Bar Change:**
```
BEFORE:
├── Logo
├── Title
└── Create New LR

AFTER:
├── Logo
├── Title
├── Create New LR
└── [User Name] Logout  ← Only addition
```

**New Login Page:**
- Clean, simple form
- Match existing color scheme
- Email + Password fields
- Forgot password link (optional)

---

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

**Phase 1: Local Testing**
1. Implement each feature locally
2. Test all existing features still work
3. Test new security features
4. No breakage allowed

**Phase 2: Git & Backup**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add authentication, audit logging, RBAC"
git push
```

**Phase 3: Railway Deploy**
1. Railway auto-deploys
2. Migrations run automatically
3. First user becomes CEO
4. Test login in production

**Phase 4: Invite Team**
```
1. Go to admin panel
2. Invite: manager@company.com (MANAGER role)
3. Invite: worker@company.com (WORKER role)
4. Invite: worker2@company.com (WORKER role - future)
```

---

## ⚠️ BACKUP & ROLLBACK PLAN

**If something breaks:**
1. Revert commit: `git revert [commit-hash]`
2. Railway redeploys
3. Data stays intact (migrations are safe)
4. Restore from backup if needed

---

## 📅 TIMELINE

**Week 1:**
- [ ] NextAuth setup (3 days)
- [ ] Login page (1 day)
- [ ] Route protection (1 day)
- [ ] Testing (1 day)

**Week 2:**
- [ ] Audit logging (2 days)
- [ ] RBAC implementation (2 days)
- [ ] User management (1 day)
- [ ] Testing (1 day)

**Week 3:**
- [ ] Backup setup (2 days)
- [ ] Test restore (1 day)
- [ ] Final testing (2 days)
- [ ] Production deploy (1 day)

---

- Data export with audit trail
- Team activity feed

---

## 📞 ROLLOUT COMMUNICATION

**When deploying:**
1. Notify team: "New login required starting [DATE]"
2. Send credentials to each person
3. Brief them: "Same dashboard, just need to login"
4. Be available for 24 hours post-deploy

---

## 🔐 SECURITY BEST PRACTICES

✅ Never store passwords in plain text  
✅ Use bcrypt for hashing  
✅ JWT tokens for sessions  
✅ HTTPS/TLS (automatic on Railway)  
✅ Environment variables for secrets  
✅ Rotate backups daily  
✅ Encrypt sensitive data  
✅ Audit all critical actions
