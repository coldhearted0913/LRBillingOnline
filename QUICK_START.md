## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Make backups** before doing major changes
- **Port 3000** must be available
- **Data persists** between restarts (saved in database)

```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```
Use port 3001 instead

### Server crashes/stops
```bash
npm run dev
```
Just restart it

### "Cannot find node_modules"

npm install
```

### Lost all data
```bash
prisma/dev.db.backup
```
Restore from backup if you have one
