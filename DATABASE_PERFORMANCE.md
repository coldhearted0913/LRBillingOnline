# Database Performance Optimization Guide

## Current Optimizations Already Implemented

### 1. **Connection Pooling** ✅
- Using PgBouncer-compatible mode
- 10 connections per instance
- Optimized connection timeouts (10 seconds)
- Fast connection recovery

### 2. **Query Optimizations** ✅
- Using SQL `WHERE` clauses for filtering (not in-memory)
- SQL `DISTINCT` for unique data
- Selective field fetching (`select` only needed fields)
- Database indexes on frequently queried columns

### 3. **React Memoization** ✅
- `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- `useCallback` for stable function references
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders

### 4. **Session Caching** ✅
- JWT token caching (user role cached for 5 minutes)
- No duplicate DB queries for session data

## Possible Causes of Slowness

### 1. **Database Location (Network Latency)**
- If your Railway app is in US but database is in Asia: **200-300ms latency**
- **Solution**: Use Railway's database addon or ensure same region

### 2. **Database Plan Limitations**
- **Free Tier**: Can be slow under load
- **Solution**: Upgrade to paid plan ($5-20/month)

### 3. **Large Dataset**
- If you have 10,000+ records
- **Solution**: Add pagination (already implemented!)

### 4. **Missing Database Indexes**
- Check if indexes are created properly
- **Solution**: Run `npx prisma db push --force` to ensure indexes

## Quick Performance Checks

### Check Database Location
```bash
# In Railway dashboard, check:
# 1. What region is your database?
# 2. What region is your app?
# They should be the same!
```

### Check Database Plan
```bash
# In Railway dashboard:
# Database → Settings → Plan
# Free tier is limited to 100MB and slower
```

### Check Number of Records
```sql
-- Run this in your database console
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lrs;
```

## Recommended Upgrades

### If Still Slow After All Optimizations:

1. **Upgrade Database Plan** ($5-20/month)
   - Better CPU and RAM
   - Faster queries
   - More connections

2. **Enable Connection Pooling** (if not enabled)
   - Neon/PostgreSQL: Free connection pooler
   - Railway: Check if pooling is enabled

3. **Add Redis Cache** ($5/month)
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Reduce database load

## Performance Testing

### Before Upgrade:
1. Measure page load time: ____ seconds
2. Measure query time: ____ milliseconds

### After Upgrade:
1. Measure page load time: ____ seconds
2. Measure query time: ____ milliseconds

## When to Upgrade

### Don't Upgrade If:
- App loads in < 3 seconds
- Queries complete in < 500ms
- You have < 1000 records

### Do Upgrade If:
- App loads in > 5 seconds
- Queries take > 1000ms
- You have > 10,000 records
- Multiple concurrent users

## Cost Estimate

| Service | Free | Paid | Improvement |
|---------|------|------|-------------|
| Database | Free | $5-20/mo | 2-5x faster |
| Redis Cache | N/A | $5/mo | 5-10x faster |
| Connection Pooling | Included | Included | Included |

## Summary

**Current Status**: Most optimizations already implemented
**Recommendation**: 
1. Check database location (should match app region)
2. Check database plan (free tier is slow)
3. Only upgrade if still slow after checking above

**Expected Performance**:
- Free tier: 2-5 seconds load time
- Paid tier ($5-20): 0.5-2 seconds load time
